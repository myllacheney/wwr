    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img alt="Image of me?" src="images/me.JPG">
    <h2>Myllayd Cheney</h2>
    <h2>Mylla</h2>
    <p>My name is Myllayd but as my name is difficult to pronounce everyone calls me Mylla.</p>
    <p>I am earning a software development degree.</p>
    <p>I love to cook, watch K-dramas with my husband, and sleep.</p>
    <p>I am married and have two boys.  No grandkids!  I am too young for that!</p>
    <p>I work as an account manager for doTerra.  I don't like customer service jobs so I am looking to change my career with this degree.  
    <p>I love that I can do everything from home with BYU-Idaho.  I am pursuing a BS degree.</p>
    <p>I will use the knowledge I gain here to pursue a more technical job that will be much more satisfying.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 2003.  My favorite quote is by David O. McKay - The home is the first and most effective place to learn the lessons of life: truth, honor, virtue, self control, the value of education, honest work, and the purpose and privilege of life. Nothing can take the place of home in rearing and teaching children, and no worldly success can compensate for failure in the home.  My favorite scripture is Ether 12:27.</p>
